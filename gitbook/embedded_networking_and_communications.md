# Embedded Networking and Communications

## Embedded Networking and Communications

* Test the design rules for your printer(s) (group project)
* Design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that could not be made subtractively
* 3D scan an object (and optionally print it)

### Learning outcomes

* Demonstrate workflows used in network design and construction
* Implement and interpret networking protocols

### Have you?

* Described your design and fabrication process using words/images/screenshots.
* Explained the programming process/es you used.
* Outlined problems and how you fixed them
* Included original design files and code

## FAQ

### Can we use arduino/commercial boards for networking?
> Answer:
1. It depends on the case: you can use commercial boards for wireless devices. But you canâ€™t use Arduino or similar commercial microcontroller boards because they can be made in the fab lab. For this week, you can use the original satcha-kit/fab-kit/fabduino.

### Must each board have a unique identity?
> Answer:
1. It does not have to be hard-coded but you must use some form of addressing.
