    "faq": "### Can we use arduino/commercial boards for networking?\n> Answer:\n1. It depends on the case: you can use commercial boards for wireless devices. But you can\u2019t use Arduino or similar commercial microcontroller boards because they can be made in the fab lab. For this week, you can use the original satcha-kit/fab-kit/fabduino.\n\n### Must each board have a unique identity?\n> Answer:\n1. It does not have to be hard-coded but you must use some form of addressing.\n",
