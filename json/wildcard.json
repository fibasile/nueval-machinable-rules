    "faq": "### Can I make the assignment by hand?\n> Answer:\n1. Although there can be manual processing steps, to count as digital fabrication the workflow should pass through design in a computer and some kind of automated output process. So programming the embroidery of circuits would count, but hand-stitching them wouldn't. \n",
