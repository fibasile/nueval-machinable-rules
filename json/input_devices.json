    "faq": "### Is the satsha kit/fabduino I fabricated considered a valid board for this assignment?\n> Answer:\n1. Fabricating an unmodified board is considered as electronics production but does not count towards any design skill.\n2. If you changed the original satsha kit/fabduino, it is a valid board.\n",
