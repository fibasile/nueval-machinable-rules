    "faq": "### Can I modify an existing design board?\n> Answer:\n1. Yes as long as you acknowledge the original design and explain your contribution to the board.\n\n### Do I need to create a schematic file?\n> Answer:\n1. If your software does not generate it no, otherwise yes. You can draw or use kokopelli which does not create schematic files.\n\n> NB.  Also, if you make a board and it doesn't work; franken-hack that board (with jumper wires etc) until it does work, then make a new one with the knowledge you have gained.\n",
