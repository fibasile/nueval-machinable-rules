    "faq": "### Does the mould have to be 3D milled?\n> Answer:\n1. No. It could be a torsion box (interlocking and skillfully joined) made on the laser or CNC, or a 3D mould.\n\n### If the composite object is made without vacuum bag/compress/compact, is it acceptable?\n> Answer:\n1. You must prove you can use compression (two molds or vacuum bag) to remove extra resin. So if you just use wet layout you should make some test coupons showing you know how to do compaction.
