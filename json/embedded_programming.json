To succeed in this project, experiment with changing the code, understand how that worked, and write your own.\n\n### How do I prove I've read the Data Sheet?\n> Answer:\n1. Point out things in your code and board design that you learnt from the Data Sheet. Also point to other weeks when you used a Data Sheet.\n",
