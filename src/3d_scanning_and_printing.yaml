tasks:
- name: 3D Scanning and Printing
  description: |
    * Test the design rules for your printer(s) (group project)
    * Design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that could not be made subtractively
    * 3D scan an object (and optionally print it)
  outcomes:
  - Identify the advantages and limitations of 3D printing and scanning technology
  - Apply design methods and production processes to show your understanding.
  checklist:
  - Described what you learned by testing the 3D printers
  - Shown how you designed and made your object and explained why it could not be made subtractively  
  - Scanned an object
  - Outlined problems and how you fixed them
  - Included your design files and ‘hero shot’ photos of the scan and the final object

  ### Define ‘cannot be made subtractively’
  > Answer:
  1. That cannot be fabricated with 3 axis limitations OR even if it’s possible to make it, it is too complicated.
