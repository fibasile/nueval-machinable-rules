  ### Is it OK to use someone else’s template to create my website?
  > Answer:
  1. Yes - acknowledge other people’s work. Show you understand how the template works by describing/changing parts of it.

  ### Can I store photos and files off the archive?

  1. No. Photos should be resized and compressed and stored in the archive. See [General Essentials](http://docs.academany.org/FabAcademy-Assessment/_book/general_essentials.html).
  2. The Global Evaluation team should be able to pull and then assess your work offline.
